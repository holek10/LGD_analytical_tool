# LGD analytical tool

Loss Given Default (LGD) estimation tool that I've developed during my time at EY (Ernst & Young) in Prague, Czech Republic.

The tool was designed specifically for a Romanian bank (Banca Transilvania) to make use of A-IRB methodology for their loan loss provisioning. Demo version has only basic functionality, while full version takes advanteage of Oracle database (two-way communication, loading and saving data back to SQL tables) and has enhanced file export capabilities. 

Demo version is accessible here: https://holek10.shinyapps.io/LGD_analytical_tool/
